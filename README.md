  <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>
  
  <p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill
    their prey by hitting them at high speed.
    They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.

  <h2>Attack</h2>
  <p>
    Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be
    <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>
    They strike by rapidly unfolding and
    swinging their claws at the prey, and can
    cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.
  </p>
  <h2>Eyesight</h2>
  <p>
    Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and
    constantly move about independently of each other.
    They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.
    <br>
    <br>
    The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can
    perceive both polarized light, and color vision
    outside the normal visual spectrum.
